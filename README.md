# AdvancedMLcourse

The notebook BO_project_Chiara_Mauri contains the code used to do the project about Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning. Part of this code is the one provided during the course - mainly because this is my first experience with Python. 

The code of the machine learning model whose hyperparameters are optimized with BO has not been uploaded because it is confidential, and the same for the data the model has been applied to.
